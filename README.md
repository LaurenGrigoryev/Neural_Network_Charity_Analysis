# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results: 

### Data Preprocessing

* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
The target of my model is variable IS_SUCCESSFUL as pictured here.

* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The features of my model are variables APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION,	CLASSIFICATION,	USE_CASE,	ORGANIZATION,	STATUS,	INCOME_AMT,	ASK_AMT,	IS_SUCCESSFUL as pictured here.

* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
The variables that are neither targets nor features are EIN, NAME, and SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS. 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
No, but I made three attempts.

* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
I removed noisy variables from features, added neurons to hidden layers, added hidden layers, and changed the activation function of output layers is changed for optimization as pictured here.
